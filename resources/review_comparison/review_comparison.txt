We stay at Hilton for 4 nights last march. It was a pleasant stay. We got a large room with 2 double beds and 2 bathrooms,
The TV was Ok, a 27' CRT Flat Screen. The coincierge was very friendly when we need.
The room was very cleaned when we arrived, we ordered some pizzas from room service and the pizza
was Ok also.The main Hall is beautiful. The breakfast is charged, 20 dollars, kinda expensive.
The internet access (WiFi) is charged, 13 dollars/day. Pros: Low rate price, huge rooms,
close to attractions at Loop, close to metro station. Cons: Expensive breakfast, Internet access charged.
Tip: When leaving the building, always use the Michigan Av exit. Its a great view.

My husband and I satayed for two nights at the Hilton Chicago,and enjoyed every minute of it!
The bedrooms are immaculate,and the linnens are very soft. We also appreciated the free wifi,as we could stay in
touch with friends while staying in Chicago. The bathroom was quite spacious,and I loved the smell of the shampoo
they provided-not like most hotel shampoos. Their service was amazing,and we absolutely loved the beautiful indoor pool.
I would recommend staying here to anyone.

I recently stayed here for the Chicago triathlon. This was my third stay at this hotel. I have not had any issues until
this visit. After the 3rd day of my stay I requested my room to be serviced and returned to what I thought was a clean room.
While getting out of bed I was cut by a piece of glass in the carpet. I must not have been the first person to be cut in
the room because I found dried blood on the bathroom floor afterwards. I had not noticed it before so I was very disgusted.
We notified the staff and asked that the room be vacuumed and the bathroom mopped. We returned to the room after 5pm to
find that the dried blood was still on the floor. After making a complaint to the customer service I have gotten no
reply from the hotel. Considering the price point of this downtown hotel I would think that they would try to live up t
he 5 star rating but instead they have failed miserably. Luckily there are many hotels to choose from in downtown Chicago.

The Hilton Chicago, located on prime real estate in downtown Chicago, has not aged as
gracefully as other hotels around the country opened during the same period of time.
The hotel does maintain the appearance of luxury that has made it iconic, but that luxury is
not in accord with 21st century standards. Lacking any form of fitness center, the Hilton is
almost alone among the major hotels of Chicago in forcing its patrons to go elsewhere for a
quick workout. Even nominal fees for wireless internet use in hotel rooms is very rare at this
point, and the outrageous parking fee of $43 for guests will discourage out of towners from making
the Hilton their destination. Most guest rooms are no different than any other Hilton anywhere, meaning
that unless you are staying in the admittedly fantastic Executive suites, you will be paying a premium for a prosaic hotel experience.
